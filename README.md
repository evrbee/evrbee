- 👀 I’m interested in behavioral, cognitive and affective neuroscience.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about temporal effects of top-down emotion regulation on affect and cognitive load using eye gaze tracking.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on studies that look at emotion regulation, attention, cognition and neurophys.
